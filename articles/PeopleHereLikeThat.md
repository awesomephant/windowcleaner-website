title: Latinos Are Very Serviceable and People Here Like That
date: 2020-08-28
---

**To give a bit of context**: My name is José García Oliva and I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. When I came to the Royal College of Art, I re­alised that the ﬁrst con­tact I had with peo­ple from South America in London were the clean­ers work­ing at the College: Julian, Jorge and Diego from Colombia, and Javier from Bolivia.

The ﬁrst thing I thought was, why are they all South American? Isn’t this just an­other por­trait of post-colo­nial­ism? South Americans clean­ing, Africans guard­ing, Europeans teach­ing. I started talk­ing to one of them for hours about types of South American food dishes (mainly ar­gu­ing whether arepas are Colombian or Venezuelan), gos­sip­ing about peo­ple pass­ing by in the halls, mi­gra­tion poli­cies, EU set­tle­ment, Brexit, and so on. Between those con­ver­sa­tions, I asked him: Why do you think you are all from South America? He said: “Latinos are very ser­vice­able, and peo­ple here like that.” Since I heard that an­swer, I have tasted the bit­ter­ness of colo­nial­is­m’s ashes, still warm, in my mouth. “Latinos are proud to be work­ing, even in a hole.” The prob­lem is that a hole will al­low them to bury you, and af­ter the hole is cov­ered up, every­one can step on you.

In an­other con­ver­sa­tion with Jorge he said, “Latinos bow their heads a lot, and when peo­ple look at us like that, they be­gin to abuse us.” It’s a side ef­fect of long-term feel­ings of in­fe­ri­or­ity, im­posed on us by the ones who are and have been served. “The past is never dead; it’s not even past,” as William Faulkner once said. Unconsciously, Latinos are still re­liv­ing their ﬁrst in­ter­ac­tion with the colonis­ers over and over again: On our part – one of as­ton­ish­ment, a cul­ture shock that seems to mir­ror our ﬁrst glimpse of the con­quis­ta­dors, and for the colonis­ers – an er­rant mis­trust in our ca­pa­bil­i­ties. The re-en­act­ment of these ab­surd the­atri­cal­i­ties, and the per­ni­cious vi­o­lence they en­gen­der, still per­sist and have even come to seem “natural” —thereby ob­scur­ing the real im­posed hi­er­ar­chy of colonised and coloniser.

“The lack of in­di­vid­u­al­ity. [This is] the ﬁrst and most se­ri­ous mu­ti­la­tion suf­fered by man when they be­come a wage earner”{% footnote "Paz, Octavio: *Labyrinth of Solitude*. (London, 2010) p. 15" %} Octavio Paz said. “Latinos are very ser­vice­able”: even if it is an ho­n­ourable fact, the so­cio-eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal con­text builds a cam­ou­ﬂaged la­bel that in­ten­si­ﬁes their in­vis­i­bil­ity, mak­ing them more vul­ner­a­ble to ma­nip­u­la­tion. As one of the clean­ers said to me, “we are will­ing to do every­thing.” This readi­ness sadly opens up a wound for the vul­tures to gorge them­selves upon. One of the many con­se­quences is stop­ping them from achiev­ing their life goals by con­sum­ing their hours with an over­load of work. Many of them would like to learn English, but how are you sup­posed to study af­ter more than 10 hours of clean­ing? {% inlineImage "/assets/bucketandmob.jpeg" "Bucket and mob of Julian"%} And then, how can you ﬁnd an­other job if you can­not speak the English re­quired? Suddenly, it be­comes a vi­cious cy­cle. During a ﬁve minute break, Diego told me, “I feel trapped in time, noth­ing hap­pens, I’m al­ways clean­ing the same.” Like Sisyphus’s pun­ish­ment — an end­less dis­so­lu­tion of their lib­erty, time, en­ergy and mo­ti­va­tion.

Some peo­ple may say, “why did they come here in the ﬁrst place if they do not speak the lan­guage?” This as­ser­tion is com­pletely il­log­i­cal. It is like ask­ing some­one, “why are you go­ing to the doc­tor if we are all even­tu­ally go­ing to die?” Others may say that the root of the prob­lem is that they are not try­ing to learn English and be­come in­volved in the com­mu­nity. But is­n’t this like ty­ing them up, throw­ing them into a river, and then blam­ing them for not swim­ming prop­erly? They may barely sur­vive, but we, as in­di­vid­u­als, are we help­ing them to swim? In other words, who cares who is clean­ing? Do you know the name of the per­son who cleans your stu­dio every morn­ing? The clean­ers have never been in­tro­duced to us, and we have never been in­tro­duced to them, even though they are more phys­i­cally pre­sent in col­lege than many of our tu­tors. Ironically, we crit­i­cise “invisible” labour within our class­rooms, but make vis­i­ble peo­ple in­vis­i­ble in the in­sti­tu­tion more broadly.

Invisibility, what a rel­e­vant word for Americans — sorry, South Americans. Even though we are Americans, Latinos seem to live on rented land. These are de­tails that cre­ate a cer­tain in­sta­bil­ity and doubt­ful iden­tity, but also for a whole cul­ture. When de­vel­oped coun­tries are na­tion­al­ist they seem to have pa­tri­o­tism; yet when de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are na­tion­al­ist, they seem to have ter­ror­ism. We have be­come used to ask­ing to have a voice. It was right when Eduardo Galeano said, “we have main­tained a si­lence closely re­sem­bling stu­pid­ity”{% footnote "Galeano, Eduardo, *EDUARDO GALEANO - MUROS*, Youtube, 2010 [youtube.com/watch?v=16mQ-jHdEqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16mQ-jHdEqo) [Accessed 11 November 2018]"%}.

People Here Like That is a par­tic­i­pa­tive per­for­mance for the WIP at the Royal College of Art in 2020{% footnote "Performance documentation, Vimeo, 2020 [https://vimeo.com/397510364](https://vimeo.com/397510364)" %}. The lo­ca­tion of the ex­hi­bi­tion is rel­e­vant since it took place out­side the RCA, in the co-work­ing site of White City Place, London. 15 out of 17 clean­ers at the RCA are South American. It was cru­cial for the con­tent of the pro­ject to high­light this is­sue in a con­text that mir­rors the pat­terns of their own labour; but more im­por­tantly, to bring an aware­ness to the priv­i­leged frame­work of the staff and stu­dent body about our in­di­vid­ual in­ter-re­la­tion­ships with these peo­ple:

*Who washes your win­dow to al­low you to see out­side?*\
*Who pol­ishes your desk so that you can work?*\
*Who var­nishes the ﬂoor for your cat­walk?*\
*Who ti­dies the class­room for you to at­tend, where you  then speak about “invisible” labour?*\
*Who mops the ﬂoor to clean up your hastily spilt ﬂat white?*\
*Who dusts for you so you can get lost in the li­brary?*\
*Who wipes the iMac screens for you to nav­i­gate the in­ter­net?*\
*Who emp­ties the bins for you to not drown in the sea of your own un­think­ingly printed pa­per?*\
*Who cleans the kitchen for you to eat your take­away?*\
*Who vac­u­ums the ﬂoor to im­prove your air qual­ity?*\
*Who dis­in­fects the han­dles for you amid COVID-19?*\
*Who washes the toi­lets for you to defe­cate?*\
*Who re­ﬁlls the toi­let pa­per for you to wipe your ass?*\
*Who is un­known?*\
*Who do you not see, ever, never look at?*\
*Whose names do you not know?*

Knowing these peo­ples’­names and grate­fully ac­knowl­edg­ing the im­por­tance of their work for the well-be­ing of our com­mu­nity are the ﬁrst step­ping stones to­wards in­clu­sive­ness. “Don’t for­get in do­ing some­thing for oth­ers that you have what you have be­cause of oth­ers. Don’t for­get that,” Martin Luther King said one day.

To end, I would like to clar­ify that my in­ten­tion is not to gen­er­al­ise a whole con­ti­nent. Whenever I ref­er­ence South America as a whole, it is only to unify the his­tor­i­cal sim­i­lar­i­ties of colo­nial­ism. I would also es­pe­cially like to thank Jorge (known as “the lawyer of the poor­est” in the London Latin American com­mu­nity) for his his­tory lessons about Colombian mi­gra­tion; Javier for his les­son about pos­i­tivism, en­cour­age­ment, and more im­por­tantly his spec­tac­u­lar sweet-corn arepas recipe; Diego for his hu­mour; and Julian for be­ing a friend.
