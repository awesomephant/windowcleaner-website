**To give a bit of context**: My name is Jose Garcia Olivia, and I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. When I came to the RCA, what I realised is that the first contact I had with people from South America in London were the cleaners working at the College (Julian, Jorge and Diego from Colombia – and Javier from Bolivia).

The first thing I thought was, why are they all South American? Isn't this another portrait of post-colonialism in front of us? South Americans cleaning, Africans guarding, Europeans teaching. I started talking to one of them for hours about types of South American dishes (mainly arguing if arepas are Colombian or Venezuelan), gossiping about people passing by, migration policies, EU settlement, Brexit and so on. Between those conversations, I asked Javier – why do you think you are all from South America? He said: Latinos are very serviceable, and people here like that. Since I heard that answer, I felt ashes of colonialism. One of them said, “Latinos are proud to be working, even in {% inlineImage "/assets/lf.jpeg" "Original *WAR IS OVER!* postcard."%} a hole”.The problem is that a hole will allow them to bury you, and after the hole is covered up, everyone can step on you.

In another conversation with Jorge, he said, “Latinos bow their heads a lot, and when people look at us like that, they begin to abuse us.” It’s a side effect of long-term feelings of inferiority, imposed on us by the ones who are and have been served. “The past is never dead; it’s not even past,” William Faulkner said once. Unconsciously, Latinos are still carrying an old astonishment by the conquerors, and the conquerors have an instinctive and errant mistrust of our capabilities. Viciously, these absurd theatricalities still persist, and the obscure the real hierarchy of colonised and coloniser. “The lack of individuality. The first and most serious mutilation suffered by man when they become a wage earner”{% footnote "Paz, Octavio: *Labyrinth of Solitude*. (London, 2010) p. 15" %} Octavio Paz said. ‘Latinos are very serviceable’: even if it is an honourable fact, the socio-economic and political context build a camouflaged label that intensifies their invisibility, making them more vulnerable to manipulation. As one of them said to me, “We are willing to do everything”. This neediness sadly opens up a wound for the vultures to gorge themselves upon. One of the many consequences is stopping them from achieving their life goals by consuming their hours with an overload of work. . Many of them would like to learn English, but how are you supposed to study after more than 10 hours of cleaning? And then, how can you find another job if you cannot speak the English required? Suddenly, it becomes a vicious cycle. In a five minute break, Diego told me, “I feel trapped in time, nothing happens, I’m always cleaning the same.”Sisyphus’s punishment – cutting their liberty, time, energy and motivation.

Some people may say, ‘why did they come here in the first place if they do not speak the language?’ This assertion is completely illogical. It is like asking someone, why are you going to the doctor if we are all eventually going to die? Others may say that the root of the problem is that they are not trying to learn English and get involved in the community. But isn’t this like tying them up, throwing them into a river, and then blaming them for not swimming properly? They may barely survive, but we, as individuals – are we helping them to swim? In other words, who cares who is cleaning? Do you know the name of the person who cleans your studio every morning? The cleaners have never been introduced to us, and we have never been introduced to them, even though they are more physically present in college than many of our tutors.

Ironically, we criticise ‘invisible’ labour within our classrooms, but make visible people invisible in the institution more broadly. Invisibility, what a relevant word for Americans – sorry, South Americans. Even though we are Americans, Latinos seem to live in rented land. These are details that create a certain instability and doubtful identity for the individual but also for a culture. When developed countries are nationalist they seem to have patriotism; yet when developing countries are nationalist, they seem to have terrorism. We have become used to asking to have a voice. It was right when Eduardo Galeano said, “we have maintained a silence closely resembling stupidity”{% footnote "Galeano, Eduardo, *EDUARDO GALEANO - MUROS*, Youtube, 2010 [youtube.com/watch?v=16mQ-jHdEqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16mQ-jHdEqo) [Accessed 11 November 2018]"%}. ‘People Here Like That’ is a participative performance for the WIP at the Royal College of Art in 2020. The location of the exhibition is relevant since it took place outside the RCA, in the coworking site White City Place, London. 15 out of 17 cleaners at this workplace are South American. It was crucial for the content of the project to highlight this issue in a context which mirrors the patterns of their own labour, but more importantly, to bring an awareness to the privileged frame of the staff and student body about our individual inter-relationship towards these people:

Who washes your window to allow you to see outside?\
Who polishes your desk so that you can work?\
Who vanishes the floor for your cat-walk?\
Who tidies the classroom for you to attend, and then talk about ‘invisible’ labour?\
Who mops the floor to clean up your hastily spilt flat white? Who dusts for you so you can get lost in the library?\
Who wipes the iMac screens for you to navigate the internet?\
Who empties the bins for you to not drown in the sea of your own unthinkingly printed paper?\
Who cleans the kitchen for you to eat your takeaway?\
Who vacuums the floor to improve your air quality?\
Who disinfects the handles for you amid Covid-19?\
Who washes the toilets for you to defecate?\
Who refills the toilet paper for you to clean your own arse?\
Who is unknown?

Knowing these people’s names and gratefully acknowledging the importance of their work for the well-being of our community, are stepping stones towards inclusiveness. “Don’t forget in doing something for others that you have what you have because of others. Don’t forget that.” Martin Luther King said it one day. To end I would like to clarify that my intention is not to generalise a whole continent. Whenever I reference South America as a whole, it is only to unify the historical similarities of colonialism. I would also especially like to thank Jorge (known as ‘the lawyer of the poorest’ in the London Latin American community) for his history lessons about Colombian migration, Javier for his lesson about positivism, encouragement and more importantly his spectacular sweet-corn arepas recipe, Diego for his humour, and Julian for being a friend.
