3. The Glass Cleaner.

In the mid-1980s, when the effects of neoliberalism began to germinate, and in the 1990s with the agreement of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), borders were opened from point to point for free trade, but not for the free movement of migrants. As a result, a group of artists located between the south of the United States and northern Mexico, together with the migratory communities there, began to re-activate urban spaces through different artistic interventions on the borders. One of the objectives was to question these contradictory socio-political spaces, in which there was a strong presence of control and surveillance that ended in violent encounters. Another aim was to bring to light the calamities of these spaces and thus raise awareness on both sides of the border. This artistic practice has continued until today, dissecting topics such as territories, emigration, xenophobia, surveillance, identity and patriotism.

&nbsp;

This artistic movement is known as Border Art. In the context of Border Art, we must highlight the presence of BAW / TAF (Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo), one of the pioneering collectives in this context that established a path for other art collectives. An example of these is InSite, an initiative that began in the early '90s, which explored the extraordinary context of Tijuana and San Diego through interventions by different commissioned artists; among these was a performance piece by Venezuelan artist Javier Téllez (2005), an enigmatic work within the history of Border Art. The project was the first time a human cannonball {% inlineImage "/assets/JavierTellezStillBalaPerdida.jpg" "One Flew over the Void (Bala Perdida). Javier Téllez. 2005 Image from: [https://www.rapidrivermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TELLE21503_web](https://www.rapidrivermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TELLE21503_web)."%} had been fired across the border with the United States. This happening polemicised the idea of border barriers in the form of "a defiant act that transgresses social and political boundaries literally and figuratively, underscoring the hardships faced by the millions of Mexican and Central American workers who cross the border illegally every year".{% footnote "‘One Flew over the Void (Bala Perdida)’, Guggenheim Collection Online [https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/33126](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/33126) [accessed 20 January 2019]." %}

"The main problem people have at the crossing is their feet. Since people are going to try anyway, at least this will make it safer.”{% footnote "‘Brinco’, LaBoutik, 2019 [https://laboutik.com/blogs/blog/focus-brinco](https://laboutik.com/blogs/blog/focus-brinco)." %}

&nbsp;

In 2005, if we look at the data, there were 473{% footnote "Geneviève Jacques and others, Estados Unidos - México Muros, Abusos y Muertos en las fronteras Violaciones flagrantes de los derechos de los migrantes indocumentados en camino a Estados Unidos (International Federation for Human Rights, March 2018), p.7" %} registered deaths of people who tried to cross the border. The deaths that are documented is always less than the actual number, since only the bodies actually found there count. In response to this humanitarian catastrophe, the Argentine artist Judi Werthein based her work on the specificity of the site and the reality of the emigrant. She designed a pair of mountain shoes {% inlineImage "/assets/brinco.jpg" "Brinco. Judi Werthein (2005). Image from: https://laboutik.com/blogs/blog/focus-brinco p.17
"%}, with motifs based on the symbolism and iconography of this dual culture, that intertwines both territories (eagle motifs and an image of St. Toribio Romo{% footnote "Mexican martyr and angel to migrants" %} – the patron saint of migrants). This work functioned as a support for migrants: first, they could have some shoes that would help them in their crossing; second, it provided them with tools – a compass, a flashlight and a mini pocket to hide money and medicine – that were essential during the crossing trip; and third, a map printed on the inner sole with the necessary information about the area. The artist sold these shoes as a limited-edition art object in San Diego for a price of $200, money that would be directed in part to the Tijuana shelter for migrants. The project can be read on several levels: if we look at the shoe itself as an object, it has a duality between leaving a mark – a symbol of presence, history and movement – and highlights the difficulty of the path. Once the work was propagated, as a result a group of people responded to the project with criticism{% footnote "These letters are exhibited in the Tate Modern." %} – together with racist vocabulary – that makes visible the social imbalance and the symptoms of xenophobia.

&nbsp;

Both these works, between site-specific art and the confluence of art and activism, are projects within the movement known as Border Art; something essential to underline here is that in this practice of contemporary art there is no modality in terms of means: the movement is instead focused on communicating and raising awareness. We can see in the following examples some of the various practices that have coexisted in this frontera art ecosystem.
