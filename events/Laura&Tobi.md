Two alumni from RCA – one activist and fashion designer, Laura Krarup & artist and writer, Károly Tendl. This lecture was our first event when we tried to bring up the broader question of what does it mean art and activism? We looked at different references from the activist perspective and the contemporary art discourses. At the end of this session, we had an open debate amongst us where we talked about the boundaries of both practices and the intersection ground.
