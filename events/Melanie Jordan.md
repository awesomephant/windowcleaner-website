In this lecture, Dr Melanie Jordan gave us a tour to her experience at working/challenging/agitating public spaces and looking at antagonism as the engine and key tool to create public sphere between participants and to activate dialogue. She clarifies to many of us the differences between the types of public: public realm, public space and public sphere through lens of contemporary art. Melanie is the third part of the trio art collective Freee. She is head of the Contemporary Art Practice (CAP) at the Royal College of Art.
