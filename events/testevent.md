Knowing these people’s names and gratefully acknowledging the importance of their work for the well-being of our community, are stepping stones towards inclusiveness. “Don’t forget in doing something for others that you have what you have because of others. Don’t forget that.” Martin Luther King said it one day. To end I would like to clarify that my intention is not to generalise a whole continent. Whenever I reference South America as a whole, it is only to unify the historical similarities of colonialism. I would also especially like to thank Jorge (known as ‘the lawyer of the poorest’ in the London Latin American community) for his history lessons about Colombian migration, Javier for his lesson about positivism, encouragement and more importantly his spectacular sweet-corn arepas recipe, Diego for his humour, and Julian for being a friend.
